## Appendix 2: Organization of the Federation

### 1. Introduction

This document defines the purpose of the Haka Federation and the criteria for membership in the Federation. This document also introduces the bodies of the Federation.

### 2. Federation

#### 2.1. Definitions

A **Federation** is a group of organizations which cooperate in the area of inter-organizational authentication and authorization and, for this purpose, operate a common infrastructure (Authentication and Authorization infrastructure, AAI).

**The Haka Federation** is the Federation founded by universities and polytechnics under the governance of the Finnish Ministry of Education. The **purpose** of the Haka Federation is to support higher education and research institutions by developing and maintaining an infrastructure for user authentication and authorization.

Universities, polytechnics, publicly funded research institutions, university hospitals and other organizations supporting research and education are allowed to join the Federation as a Federation Member as described in section 2.2. The Federation may also use external partners (Federation Partner). Both Members and Partners are subject to the requirement to process personal data in compliance with the purpose of the Federation (Personal Data Act, Section 7) and to the requirements set in Appendix 3.

Within the federation framework, a Federation Member can act both as a Home Organization and a Service Provider.

**Home Organization** means a university, polytechnic, publicly funded research institution, university hospital or other organization supporting research and education that has signed the Agreement for Federation Members, maintains the identity and attributes of the End Users affiliated to the organization and is responsible for authenticating them in the AAI.

**Service Provider** means an organization that has signed the Agreement for Federation Members or the Agreement for Federation Partners and provides services to End Users in Home Organizations. A Service Provider can be a higher education institution, research institution, a joint venture of them or another organization.

#### 2.2. Federation participants

Participants in the Haka Federation are divided as follows:

- **Members**, being allowed to act both as Home Organizations and Service Providers in the Federation
  * Category A:
	- universities as defined by the Universities Act (24th of  July 2009/558)
	- polytechnics as defined by the Polytechnics Act (351/2003) and other acts in force in Finland
  * Category B:
	- bodies, authorities and research institutes of science and arts which are founded by law for public duty in Finland 
	- university hospitals, and
	- other organizations for the public good or publicly owned organizations supporting research and education in universities, polytechnics and research institutes and university hospitals mentioned above (such as CSC, the Finnish IT Center for Science)

    The membership of organizations in category B is subject to approval by the Advisory Committee of the Federation upon a proposal made by the Federation Operator.

- **Partners**, which are not Home Organizations but provide services to End Users in them (such as KELA, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and YTHS, the Finnish Student Health Service Foundation). Taking Partners to the Federation is subject to approval by the Advisory Committee upon a proposal made by the Federation Operator. Partners shall sign a Service Agreement for Federation Partners with the Federation Operator.

Taking the Federation Operator as a Home Organization or a Service Provider is subject to approval by the Advisory Committee.
