## Appendix 8: Prices

The services described in this Agreement are funded from the fees agreed in the Service Agreement between CSC and Funet member organizations. For non-Funet member organizations CSC defines pricing based on the costs of the development of the service and costs accrued from the services. 

Prices for services provided by CSC - IT Center for Science Ltd, when not included in Appendix 3, are set forth separately.
